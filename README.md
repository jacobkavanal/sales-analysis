# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Database**: `p1_retail_db`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.

## Project Structure

### Database

The dataset utilized for this project consists of sales data from a retailer. Each observation is a transaction with attributes such as date, time, product category, total sale amount, and more.
